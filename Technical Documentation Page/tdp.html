                <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open-source scripting language primarily designed for web development. It was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, a Danish-Canadian programmer, as a set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts written in C. Initially, Lerdorf developed PHP to track visits to his online resume, naming it "Personal Home Page Tools" (PHP Tools).</p>
                <p>In 1995, PHP/FI (Form Interpreter) was released as the first version, with basic functionality for web development, allowing users to create simple dynamic websites. Due to its ease of use and integration with HTML, PHP quickly gained popularity. By 1997, PHP had undergone significant improvements, and two Israeli developers, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, rewrote its core, leading to the release of PHP 3 in 1998. This version rebranded PHP as "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" and introduced support for a broader range of databases and protocols, which greatly expanded its functionality.</p>
                <p>PHP 4, released in 2000, introduced the Zend Engine, which dramatically improved performance. Subsequent versions continued to enhance security, performance, and object-oriented programming features. PHP 5, released in 2004, further strengthened object-oriented programming, and PHP 7, released in 2015, brought significant speed improvements and reduced memory usage.</p>

                    <p>Is PHP dead?</p>
                    <li>PHP is used by about 78% of all websites(For curious people, python is about 2%)</li>
                    <li>Popular websites using PHP: facebook, wikipedia, canva, wordpress(Content Management System).</li>
                    <li>PHP is constantly improving and receiving updates.</li>
